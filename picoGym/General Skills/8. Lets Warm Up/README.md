## Description
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

## Approach
In the context of hexadecimal, the **'0x'** in **0x70** is an indication that it is indeed in a hexadecimal format, the **'70'** part tells the decimal. Following the ASCII table, **'70'** in decimal, is **'p'**. 

Making our flag:
```text
picoCTF{p}
```
