It may seem intimidating at first, but it is actually easy and all you have to do is find this:

Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do! -h     
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_6635aa47}  
I don't know what '%s' means! I do know what -h means though!

// picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_6635aa47}
